            <h2>Train your mind to break bad habits, ingrain better thought processes or just remind yourself of things your trying to remember. <br> 
            <br>In the Thoughts Response page in the text field "Add Your Thought" write the initial thought that you would like to work on.<br>
            <br>In the text field "Add Your Response" write a response to that thought. Not the one that your mind usually uses as a response but instead the response that will actually benefit you the most <br>
            <br>You then see the thought written out and when you have that thought you select the response button which will pop up the response you want to have instead of your usual response.
            <br> 

            <br>Example Thought: "I should eat another pizza"
            <br>Usual Response: "Yes that Pie won't eat itself"
            <br>New response: "That was enough I will have some fruits and veggies instead"
